          Bangladesh (/ˌbæŋləˈdɛʃ/,[14] Bengali: বাংলাদেশ, pronounced
          [ˈbaŋlaˌdeʃ] (About this soundlisten)), officially the People's
          Republic of Bangladesh, is a country in South Asia. It is the
          eighth-most populous country in the world, with a population exceeding
          162 million people.[15] In terms of land mass, Bangladesh ranks 92nd,
          spanning 148,460 square kilometres (57,320 sq mi), making it one of
          the most densely-populated countries in the world. Bangladesh shares
          land borders with India to the west, north, and east, Myanmar to the
          southeast, and the Bay of Bengal to the south. It is narrowly
          separated from Nepal and Bhutan by the Siliguri Corridor, and from
          China by Sikkim, in the north, respectively. Dhaka, the capital and
          largest city, is the nation's economic, political and cultural hub.
          Chittagong, the largest sea port, is the second-largest city.
